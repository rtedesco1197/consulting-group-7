# Consulting Capstone Project

In this project, we develop various GLM's for Lesley Mills, a scientist at the EPA. Lesley has ran an experiment in order to determine whether or not aromatase inhibitors (drugs used to treat breast cancer) have a significant effect on fish fertility. Because our standard linear regression has assumptions violated, we use the Beta distribution GLM with the loglog link function. We utilize the Beta distribution as fish fertility can expressed as a percentage of eggs viable/fertile- percantages work great with the Beta distribution

Our analysis finds that the high concentrations of various aromatase inhibitors have a significant effect on percentage of eggs viable/fertile. Therefore, assuming all of these drugs have the same effiacy in humans, we should priortize producing the aromatase inhibitor with the slightest effect on fish fertility.
